# ArrayAndLoop

This problem is solve by Md. Asif Imtiyaj Chowdhury and this is a very basic problem solving using arrays and loops.

The question is 
"Write a Java program that reads student scores, gets the best score, and then assigns grades based on the following scheme:
Grade is A if score is ≥ best - 10
Grade is B if score is ≥ best - 20;
Grade is C if score is ≥ best - 30;
Grade is D if score is ≥ best - 40;
Grade is F otherwise.
The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts the user to enter all of the scores and concludes by displaying the grades."

You can run the code by yourself and test it. 

All the best.
